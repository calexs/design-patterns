# Design Patterns N1 Activity (EC6)

This is N1 activity of the Programming Language subject from Faculdade de Tecnologia Termomecanica (FTT)

## First rules:

- Group of 5 members (don't create smaller groups)
- Not necessarily the same group of the other activities
- Only 1 member will post (That's me!)

## Activity

- Select 2 design patterns
- For each one, defines:
  - Name
  - Type
  - Purpose
  - UML Diagram that represents him
- Implement a code that makes references for each one of them
- Post on GitHub
- Submit the repo link as well as the group members name

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Setup

### Setting the environment

1. Choose your favorite IDE (Mine is VS Code)
2. Install the Java(TM) by Red Hat extension, currently I'm using version: 0.82.0. Here is the <a href=" https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java">link</a> for VS Marketplace.
3. Download <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html">`JDK 11`</a> or any further version.

### Local Installation

1. Git clone this repo to your local machine:

```console
   https://github.com/calexs/design-patterns.git
```

2. Go to the local repo folder

```console
  cd design-patterns
```

## Design Pattern #1

- Name: Computer Factory
- Type: Creational
- Purpose: Factory design patterns intend that you change direct layers of object building to layers a special factory method. The objects returned by a this type of method are called products

- FactoryTwo <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PtQxouXs8BPet8z6f9g7UEQjbK00YRLa/view?usp=sharing">UML Diagram</a>

## Design Pattern #2

- Name: Bridge
- Type: Structural
- Purpose: The bridge design pattern split this major class into two classes hierarchically separated, so then they can be modified independently of each other
